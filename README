This explains all the files

    arduino_array : this contains the array (excluding the leading 0xff 0xff)
    that goes into the Transmit.ino message array

    encode.cpp : algorithm to encode the tom_lee.txt. Creates a file called
    encoded_output

    encoded_output: output of running encode.exe on tom_lee.txt. This is about
    41% of the original tomo_lee.txt file size...Nice!

    decode.cpp : algorithm to decode the encoded_output file produced by runing
    make

    decoded_output : produced wien running decode.exe on the encoded_output
